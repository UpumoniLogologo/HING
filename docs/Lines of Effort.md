# **Custom Web-based Solution Planning**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This will be the main route moving forward.

* Determine API compatibility

* Determine Data Sources

   * Access to Data Sources

      * Authentication and Authorization

         * API Keys

         * Database

## **Line 1**: Access + Data

* Way points, fields affected (RAPIDS, FIRMS, 911/State, WebEOC, ARCGIS, NGB COP)

## **Line 2**: Clarity of data points

* Waypoint placement (amount)

* Dashboard information

## **Line 3**: API Inter-compatibility

* Leaflet, Windy, FlightRadar24, BreezoMeter

* Layers, Filters, Toggles

## **Line 4**:  Security

*	API Keys (encryption)

*	Data security
  
*	SQL database for login

## **Line 5**: Systems + Equipment

* PAAS/Hosting, Domain

* Equipment handling (Specifications)

* Security: DDoS, API-key provider, encryption
  
* Regulations with sensitive data storage

*	Update Delays

> [!WARNING]
> Line 6 from the Lines of Effort (LOE), will not be implemented due to project scope.

## **Line 6**: Data for ML & Waypoints based on high/possible risk

·	Importing multiple datasets

·	Learning time for multiple cycles

·	Multiple iterations/models for data output

·	LLM and ML methods for consideration

·	Integrate into a API for dashboard as chatbot

# **WebEOC Solution Planning**
> [!NOTE]
> This route is decrepit!

## **Line 1**: Access + Data

* Way points (RAPIDS, FIRMS, 911/State, WebEOC, ARCGIS, NGB COP)

## **Line 2**: Clarity of data points

## **Line 3**: API Inter-compatibility, Learning System

* Windy, FlightRadar24, BreezoMeter

* Features, Filtering, Layers, Filters, Toggles

## **Line 4**:  Security

* API Keys (Locked sources of data)

## **Line 5**: Data for ML & Waypoints based on high/possible risk
