**Document For Request**

**Mission Objective**

2025 JOC â€“ P3I: Mission objective is to aggregate multiple open-source data into one software solution in a form of a web page. This project will aggregate multiple sources from State and government sources to help task emergency services of the National Guard and State to pull resources from available flight units to combat wildfires across the counties in the State of Hawaii.

**Problem Statement**

Due to the limitations of the software solutions that will be the final result, we need information that is not locked away by requests-only access and/or is not locked by API access keys such as a higher-tier paid service requirement or services locked to enterprise environments. In addition, for APIs to have inter-compatibility with one another to ensure that they can be used in the end product. This will require documentation of the software solution and APIs, access to those API keys and programming interface and authorization as well. For predictability of future events, this project will need access to a server, or hardware solutions that will make use of certain compute units that can process data fast enough for machine learning and possible LLM usage. Similarly, the data pulled must follow a certain format, which can help mitigate further processing and delays in output processes.

**Summary**

This document is  requesting for additional resources critical to the mission objective to gathering intelligence and data required for analyzing and incorporating to the selected software solution.
