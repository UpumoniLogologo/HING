**WEBOS Framework**

WEBEOS is a web-based software solution that encompasses emergency, state, military, and federal agencies + departments for emergency notifications, event tracking, and incident management systems.

WEBEOS contains multiple interlocking APIs that pull data from supported state and government agencies that feed that data into the system. Most of these data are locked behind request-only and government authorization. Due to time constraints from research and development and addition required datasets and feeds, it would be recommended to develop a system under WEBEOS. Some example of the supported APIs are ARCGIS, NASA’s FIRMs. Which are either limited my a threshold usage count or limited by enterprise request.

**Overview**

Data from the inputs are validated before being posted to the “board.”
